# 2. Data Processing Basics
This chapter mainly introduces data processing related to logistics network modeling, focusing on geographical information data, as well as economic and social data, etc. First, [Section 2.1](chapter2/2.1.data_structure.md) introduces the classification of data and their storage structure, and then introduces some tools used to edit and display these data, and how to visualize the data ([Section 2.2]( chapter2/2.2.data_visualization.md)). In [Section 2.3](chapter2/2.3.geodata_analysis.md) learn how to analyze geographic data through some simple practical cases. The final [Section 2.4](chapter2/2.4.network_topology.md) introduces how to construct the logistics network topology based on geographical data analysis, and also paves the way for the construction of other network models in subsequent chapters.
