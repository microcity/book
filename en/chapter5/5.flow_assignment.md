# 5. Network Flow Assignment
The previous chapters have addressed facility location problems and route planning problems in logistics networks respectively. In actual logistics network operations, besides determining facility locations and transportation routes, it is also necessary to decide how much flow to allocate on each edge (or path) of the network, which is the network flow assignment problem. Flow assignment must not only satisfy network flow balance constraints, but also consider multiple objectives such as transportation costs, capacity limitations, and service levels. We first introduce the most fundamental [5.1. Minimum Cost Flow Model](chapter5/5.1.minimum_flow.md), which is a classic problem in network flow theory, used in logistics networks to find the most economical flow allocation scheme that satisfies supply and demand balance. Then we explore [5.2. Nonlinear Network Flow](chapter5/5.2.nonlinear_flow.md), which deals with flow assignment methods when transportation costs or capacity constraints exhibit nonlinear characteristics. Next, we introduce [5.3. Benders Decomposition](chapter5/5.3.benders_decomposition.md) technique, which is an effective decomposition method for solving large-scale mixed integer programming problems, particularly suitable for network flow problems with complex constraints. Finally, we discuss [5.4. Spatial Price Equilibrium](chapter5/5.4.price_equilibrium.md) models, which consider flow assignment under market mechanisms and have important applications in multi-regional logistics network planning.
