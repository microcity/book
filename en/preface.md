# Preface
The earliest idea of writing this textbook was more than ten years ago, when I first took over two courses in the logistics department: "Logistics Information Management" and "Logistics System Simulation". After looking through relevant Chinese and English textbooks on the market, I feel that some textbooks are too obscure and full of various mathematical symbols; while others are more practical and use popular commercial software. I gave up using ready-made textbooks and instead tried to use my own methods to teach, using the open source software [MicroCity](https://github.com/microcity/desktop) developed during my PhD. This software was originally used to study urban spatial planning and combine it with logistics courses. Unexpectedly, the feedback received was very good. At this time, I came up with the idea of writing a textbook, but I felt that the knowledge system was not mature enough.

Later, two postgraduate courses were opened: "Shipping Big Data and Intelligent Algorithms" and "Transportation Data Analysis and Modeling" (for international students). During the class, I felt that although I was a graduate student, the theoretical foundation that students learned in undergraduate studies was not solid, so I inserted part of the undergraduate courses into the graduate courses. At the practical level of courses, there are more and more software options, but they still feel inconvenient, such as the need for installation and configuration. Therefore, I developed a network-based [MicroCity Web](..), which is more concise and convenient than the desktop version. With a browser, it works out of the box on any platform, anywhere. Until this point, I felt it was time to write an online version of the textbook, for logistics students and practitioners, who can practice directly while reading without leaving the immersive environment, thereby reducing unnecessary obstacles and distractions .

## About this book
This book is intended for undergraduates and graduate students in the logistics department as well as practitioners in the logistics industry. It focuses on analyzing data in the logistics process from the perspective of network planning, establishing mathematical models and designing algorithms, and finally solving problems. It has a certain guiding role in the planning, design and operation management of logistics and supply chain systems. This book can be used as a textbook or reference book for courses such as "Logistics System Planning", "Logistics Information Management", "Logistics System Simulation", etc. It can also be used for related courses in the transportation major. Reading this book requires a foundation in operations research and programming. A paper version of this book will be published later. The paper version is more theoretical and contains more cases, making it suitable for long-term offline reading. If you have suggestions and comments about this book, you can submit an issue on the project page of [GitHub](https://github.com/microcity/book) or [Gitee](https://gitee.com/microcity/book).

## Practice now
As a new form of textbook, a major feature of this book is that it integrates an online practice environment. The theoretical knowledge learned can be applied immediately without leaving the immersive environment. Below is a demonstration example. You can see an embedded web application MicroCity Web, with a button bar above and a message bar below. The code area is on the left and the scene area is on the right. If this is your first time using it, click the run button![](../img/play.svg) to see a rotating cube (you need to click again on your phone or tablet![](../img/code.svg )), try clicking Pause![](../img/pause.svg) and using the left and right mouse buttons (some browsers require canceling mouse gestures) to control the perspective. For more detailed information about the use of the software, please refer to the built-in documentation, the [Software Guide] (appendix/soft_guide.md) in the appendix, and the practical content of each chapter.
